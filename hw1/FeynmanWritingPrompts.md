**1. Variables:**

Containers for storing data/information.

*var fistName = 'MaNu';*

*Var favoriteNumber = 4;*


**2. Strings:**

Any text inside (single/double) quotes.

*'Hello World!'*

*'4'*

**3. Functions (arguments, return):**

A block of code that executes a task. 
It can contain “names” inside the parenthesis (parameters) and a “return” inside the curly brackets that stops the function.
You need to invoke/call the function to run it. It can contain values inside the parenthesis (arguments).

*function nameFunction(parameter1, parameter2){code to be executed;}*

*nameFunction(argument1, argument2);*


**4. if statements**

Different actions (block of code) for different conditions. This code is executed when the condition is true.

*if (condition) {code to be executed when the condition is true;}*

**5. Boolean values (true, false)**

A way to know if something is true. It’s like a “Yes/No” for anything we want to know. Just ask the question:

*Boolean (2\*3 = 6)     ->  returns true.*

*2\*3 = 6               ->  also returns true.*

*1 + 1 = 4              ->  return false.*
